# Product Sales exploratory data analysis ZARA

## Project Background
Zara, founded in 1974, is a global fashion retailer that designs, manufactures, and sells clothing and accessories worldwide through its stores, website, and mobile app.

The Company has significant amounts of data on its product inventory(over 20000 products), how they are categorized and their sales performance. This project thoroughly analyzes and explores this data in order to uncover critical insights and help improve Zara's success in the retail/fashion industry.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

⦁	Sales Trends Analysis: Evaluation of sales patterns across seasons and product types, focusing on Revenue, SKU count, and Average Revenue per Product.
⦁	Product Category Performance: An analysis of ZARA's product categories, understanding their impact on sales and revenue.
⦁	Season comparisons: An evaluations of sales across seasons
⦁	Promotions Effectiveness: Assessment of how promotions impact sales volume and revenue across different product types.
⦁	Gender Performance: Analysis of revenue and average revenue per SKU by gender

## Executive Summary:

### Overview of Findings

We generated $885M in total sales, with Jackets/Outerwear contributing about 40% of total revenue at $358M.Revenue is highest in Autumn and Winter, while Summer items earn the most per product despite fewer SKUs. Promotions boost sales volumes by about 61% across all product types, even at lower prices. Most revenue across multiple categories contribute to having high product inventory, the following section will explore additional contributing factors and highlight key opportunity areas for improvement.

Below is a overview snapshot of a interactive dashboard I made in excel with more examples included below. You can download excel dashboard here

### Sales Trends

* Total sales across all products reached $885M, driven primarily by a high SKU count (20,251 products).

* Average revenue per product is $43.7K, indicating revenue is spread evenly rather than concentrated in a few items.

* Sales performance is driven more by product mix and assortment breadth than by price changes or volume spikes.

### Promotion Effectiveness

* Promoted products average ~1,412 units sold vs ~872 units for non-promoted items, a ~62% increase in sales volume.
  

* Promotions reduce average prices by ~15% ($38 vs $45) but still result in higher overall unit movement.
  

* This shows promotions are an effective demand lever, trading margin for volume consistently across all product types.
